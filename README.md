E-kutumb is a user-friendly mobile app for efficient society management. Built on Android Studio, we utilized Java, XML, and PHP, with Firebase and REST API for seamless database integration. 

The app offers distinct logins for both chairman and members. 
Chairman features include member management, notice boards, bill generation, and an in-app messenger for streamlined communication. 
Members can access a dashboard to view society information, notices, bills, and update their profiles conveniently - Android Studio, Java
